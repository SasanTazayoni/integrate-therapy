  "My relationships with people have always been hit or miss. I either get along very well with people or badly with little in between. Simon has helped me to get in touch with my anger. I felt well supported, understood and listened to. He was great at keeping me on track when I lost direction. Overall therapy has been challenging but nonetheless very helpful.",
  "I was having a tough time in my life where I had lost my partner and was spiralling into a depression. I had a lot of difficulty coping and had no one to talk to. Simon enabled me to move forward and get my life back together. Thank you.",
  "The thought of telling someone very personal information about myself was very daunting but I knew that I had to push myself to take initiative if I wanted a better life. Simon is non-judgemental, trustworthy and human and with the therapy that I received, I was able to address all of my problems individually. I have been through a life-changing process with him.",
  "I was always confident and never imagined that I would need therapy. After the death of my father I felt overwhelmed and extremely vulnerable. With Simonâ€™s help, I was able to find myself again and have restored my self-confidence. I highly recommend him.",
