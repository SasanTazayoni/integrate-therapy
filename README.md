## Introduction

Integrate Therapy is a professional psychotherapy website created to provide an accessible and trustworthy online presence for a private practice. The aim was to give prospective clients a clear understanding of the services offered, provide answers to common questions, and make it simple to get in touch. By building a dedicated space online, the project ensures that people looking for therapy can find reliable information quickly and feel confident in reaching out.

The site achieves this by presenting clear, structured content tailored to adults who may be considering therapy for the first time or looking to continue their therapeutic journey. Visitors can learn about the therapist, understand fees and cancellation policies, explore answers to FAQs, and submit enquiries directly through a built-in form. The website is designed to reassure and inform, offering an approachable entry point to therapy both online and in person.

This project represents the first web application I ever developed. It began as a simple static site built with just HTML and CSS, later incorporating small amounts of JavaScript for interactivity. Over time, the interface and structure were improved, and the project was rebuilt using React and TypeScript. With each stage, I refined the UI, improved performance, and introduced reusable components, transforming the site into a more modern, scalable application.

The result is more than just an informational site — it’s a resource designed with care for accessibility, clarity, and professionalism. It reflects both the values of Integrate Therapy and my own growth as a developer, combining a meaningful real-world application with the opportunity to continually expand and improve my technical skills.

### Design

#### Overall feel

The Integrate Therapy website embraces a calm, modern, and inviting aesthetic designed to foster trust and clarity. Its clean layouts, soothing palette, and approachable typography create a sense of warmth without sacrificing professionalism, while clear navigation and visual hierarchy gently guide users through the information. The design prioritises responsiveness and accessibility, ensuring the experience feels consistent and inclusive across all devices. More than just an informational site, it serves as a supportive bridge -encouraging visitors to feel safe, understood, and confident in taking the next step toward therapy.

#### Colour palette

![Integrate Therapy colour palette](documentation/colourpalette.png)

This colour palette works well for the website because the combination of bright and deep blues conveys trust, calmness, and professionalism, while the light grey and white backgrounds keep the design clean and approachable, and the subtle accent shades provide clarity and visual hierarchy without overwhelming the user.

#### Typography

Open Sans is used for body text, while Lora is used for headings. This combination was a deliberate choice to create a calm, professional, and approachable aesthetic. Open Sans provides clean, highly readable text for comfortable reading, and Lora adds elegance and visual distinction to headings, helping guide the user’s attention while reinforcing a sense of trust and credibility throughout the site.

#### Wireframes

All Wireframes were designed for larger screens such as laptops or computers; for medium sized screens such as tablets or large phones; and for small screens down to the smallest phone display. The wireframes were made with desktop and mobile views and can be viewed here:
