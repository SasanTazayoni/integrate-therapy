# Introduction

Integrate Therapy is a professional psychotherapy website created to provide an accessible and trustworthy online presence for a private practice. The aim was to give prospective clients a clear understanding of the services offered, provide answers to common questions, and make it simple to get in touch. By building a dedicated space online, the project ensures that people looking for therapy can find reliable information quickly and feel confident in reaching out.

The site achieves this by presenting clear, structured content tailored to adults who may be considering therapy for the first time or looking to continue their therapeutic journey. Visitors can learn about the therapist, understand fees and cancellation policies, explore answers to FAQs, and submit enquiries directly through a built-in form. The website is designed to reassure and inform, offering an approachable entry point to therapy both online and in person.

This project represents the first web application I ever developed. It began as a simple static site built with just HTML and CSS, later incorporating small amounts of JavaScript for interactivity. Over time, the interface and structure were improved, and the project was rebuilt using React and TypeScript. With each stage, I refined the UI, improved performance, and introduced reusable components, transforming the site into a more modern, scalable application.

The result is more than just an informational site — it’s a resource designed with care for accessibility, clarity, and professionalism. It reflects both the values of Integrate Therapy and my own growth as a developer, combining a meaningful real-world application with the opportunity to continually expand and improve my technical skills.
